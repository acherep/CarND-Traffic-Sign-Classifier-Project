    "## Rubric Points\n",
    "Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is **34799**.\n",
    "* The size of the validation set is **4410**.\n",
    "* The size of test set is **12630**.\n",
    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is **(32, 32, 3)**.\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is **43**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing the number of each road sign appeared in the training, validation and test data sets. Obviously, the road signs are not equally distributed throughout the data sets. For example, pictures of \"Speed limit (20km/h)\" are 10 times less present in the data sets than \"Speed limit (30km/h)\" (see first and second bars in the bar chart). This means that the first road sign might be underlearned by the neural network because of lack of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][data_visualization]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to normalize the image data as a preprocessing step because it makes the problem to become well conditioned which, in turn, makes it easier for the optimizer to do its job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart of normalization, there is no difference between the the original data set and the augmented data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model reproduces the standard *LeNet* configuration taking into account *RGB* image inputs. It consists of the following layers:\n",

    "### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I use *Adam Optimizer* provided by *TensorFlow*. The batch size is set to $128$. The learning rate is $0.001$.The number of epochs is $10$. The initial weighs of convolutional and fully connected layers are chosen based on a truncated normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $0.1$. The difference to the normal distribution is in re-picking those generated values that are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "### Test a Model on New Images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm living in Germany, I've taken photos of 7 road signs myself and tried to classify them using the outcome of the previous steps. Here are the images:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric).\n",
